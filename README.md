# CAN-based-node-communication-for-Automotive-MICROCONTROLLER-
A Controller Area Network (CAN bus) is a vehicle bus standard designed to allow
Microcontrollers and devices to communicate with each other in applications without a
host computer. It is a message-based protocol, designed originally for multiplex
electrical wiring within auto-mobiles, but is also used in many other contexts. The goal
of this project is to implement CAN protocol based data exchange between two PIC
based boards, which are acting as “nodes”. In this implementation automotive use-case
is assumed by exchanging data like rpm, speed etc that are displayed using LCD panels.
Real Time Applications : 
1.Automotive Systems – Used in vehicles for communication between ECUs (Engine Control Units), sensors, and actuators to exchange data like Speed, RPM, Gear, Indicator etc.
2.Industrial Automation – Used for data exchange between controllers, robots, and sensors in manufacturing systems and process automation.
3.Embedded Systems Development – Provides a foundation for learning real-time communication protocols between microcontrollers in embedded applications.
